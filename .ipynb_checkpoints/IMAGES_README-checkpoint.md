# ðŸ“Š Saved Visualizations - House Price Estimator

## Overview

All visualizations from the House Price Estimator Jupyter notebook are automatically saved to the `images/` directory when you run the notebook.

## Saved Images (12 Total)

## Usage

### How Images Are Saved

When you run the notebook, each visualization cell automatically:
1. Creates the plot
2. Saves it to `images/` directory with a descriptive filename
3. Displays the plot in the notebook
4. Prints a confirmation message (e.g., "ðŸ’¾ Saved: images/01_price_distribution.png")

### Viewing Saved Images

All images are saved in the `images/` directory in the same folder as your notebook:

```
House_Price_Estimator/
â”œâ”€â”€ House_Price_Estimator.ipynb
â”œâ”€â”€ images/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 01_price_distribution.png
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 02_sqft_vs_price.png
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 12_residual_plot.png
```

### Using Images in Reports

These high-resolution images can be used in:
- Research papers
- Presentations (PowerPoint, Google Slides)
- Blog posts
- Reports and documentation
- Portfolio projects

## Re-generating Images

To regenerate all images:
1. Open `House_Price_Estimator.ipynb` in Jupyter
2. Run all cells: `Kernel > Restart & Run All`
3. All images will be automatically recreated in the `images/` directory

The images will overwrite existing files with the same names.

## Image Quality

- All images are saved at **300 DPI**, which is:
  - Suitable for printing
  - High enough for professional presentations
  - Excellent for digital displays
  - Publication-ready quality

## Technical Details

### Dependencies

The image saving functionality requires:
- `matplotlib` - for creating and saving plots
- `seaborn` - for styled visualizations
- `pandas` - for data manipulation
- `numpy` - for numerical operations

### Code Integration

Image saving is integrated into each visualization cell using:
```python
plt.savefig('images/XX_descriptive_name.png', dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')
```

The `bbox_inches='tight'` parameter ensures:
- No whitespace is cut off
- All labels and titles are included
- Optimal framing of the visualization

**Note**: The `images/` directory is automatically created when you run the notebook if it doesn't already exist.
